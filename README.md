Programming for Data Analysis Project - November - December 2018

This repository contains the workings and final notebook for the project submmited as part of the requirements for the Programming for Data Analysis module of the HDip in Data Analytics (GMIT). 


The main body of work is contained in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/davesheils/ProgDA_Project/blob/master/Programming%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Part%203%20-%20Simulation.ipynb)

Two other Jupyter Notebooks contains "rough work" for this project. They are not to be considered earlier versions of the main notebooks. These notebooks are:

[Notebook 1 Data Preparation](https://github.com/davesheils/ProgDA_Project/blob/master/Programming%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Data%20Preparation.ipynb): Note this code references a datset which is not contained in this repository and is the result of work done outside the repository.

[Notebook 2 Data Analysis](https://github.com/davesheils/ProgDA_Project/blob/master/Programming%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20%20Part%202%20-%20Analysis.ipynb)

[Source Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davesheils/ProgDA_Project/master/GraduateSampleNua2017.csv) analyised in Note book 2. 

To view and run the python code in these notebooks, you must have the [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) installed on your machine. In addition, you must have Python 3.6 installed. Both this python version and the Jupyter Notebook software can be installed as a package using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Python distribution.
