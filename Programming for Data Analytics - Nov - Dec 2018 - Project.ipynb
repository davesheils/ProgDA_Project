    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing.  You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life.  Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",

    "Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set.  Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files.  It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.  The next section gives an example project idea. Page 1 of 4\n",

After some research, I decide that the most interesting variable related to this is the mark a student receives in the module - this is going to be one of my variables (grade).\n",

The hours and grade variables will be non-negative real number with two decimal places, logins will be a non-zero integer and qual will be a categorical variable with four possible values: none , bachelors, masters, or phd.\n",

    "The aim of this project will be to investigate a dataset of students entering in the years 2012 and 2013 and graduating in 2016 or 2017 (double check correct years). Specifically, for Honours degrees, I want to investagate the distribution of final grades and see if there is a link between final grade achived and other factors, for example, gender, previous school attendedm, age on entry and LC points. The idea is to see if the dgrade distributions as a whol or for sunbgroups of entrants can be modelled by one of the more commonly used distributions used in the social sciences (e.g. pareto, do only 20% of students get a first, etc).\n",
